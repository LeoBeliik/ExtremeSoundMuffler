Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively.

**This Mod needs FORGE to work.**

### HOW IT WORKS:

**1-** Click on the button in your inventory or asign a key to open the gui.

**2-** Click on the button next to the sound you want to muffle.

**3-** Optional: set the volume of the sound dragging the slider around.

**4-** Enjoy peace.

**Some entities (like minecarts) make a constant sound, they need to be replaced after you mute the sound or you can set the master volume to 0 and back to your preferred volume, this sounds cannot be muffled, only muted.**

You can toggle the muffled sound on/off with the **toggle muffle button**.

You can set the volume of the sounds by dragging the **Slider** around.

You can play the sound pressing the **play button** next to the sound name.

You can search sounds; click on the **search bar** and type the name of the sound you want.

You can browse between the **Recent sounds**, **All the sounds** and the **Muffled sounds** pressing the corresponding button in the GUI.

You can configure **Anchors** (10 max) to muffle sounds in a configurable blocks radius (max of 32 blocks).

You can **rename Anchors**.

You can **disable Anchors** in the **config**.

You can **change the location of the Anchors** whenever you want.

You can **delete** the **sounds muffled list** or the selected **Anchor** pressing the delete button.

The list of muffled sounds are stored in the **profile folder**, so you don't need to re-muffle the sounds on every world.

**Anchors** are saved in **ESM/ServerWorld/** if you're **playing on a server**, otherwise they are **saved on the player**.

Sounds can be **blacklisted in the config**; blacklisted sounds won't appear in the GUI.

You can set the **default volume** for the muffled sounds in the config.
