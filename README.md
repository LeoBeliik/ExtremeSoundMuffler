Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively.

**This Mod needs FORGE to work.**

### HOW IT WORKS:

**1-** Click on the button in your inventory or asign a key to open the gui.

**2-** Click on the button next to the sound you want to muffle.

**3-** Drag the slider to set your preferred volume.

**4-** Enjoy peace.

**Some objects (like minecarts) make a constant sound, they need to be broken and placed after you muffle the sound, or you can set your Master volume to 0 for a moment.**

You can enable the volume slider pressing the **toggle muffle button**.

You can play the sound pressing the **play button** next to the sound name. 

You can search sounds with the **search bar** just type the name of the sound you want.

You can browse between the **Recent sounds**, **All the sounds** and **Muffled sounds** pressing the corresponding button in the GUI.

You can configure **Anchors** (10 max) to muffle sounds.

You can configure the **Radious** of the **Anchor** pressing the **Edit Anchor button**.

You can rename **Anchors**.

You can **disable Anchors** in the config.

You can change the location of the **Anchors** whenever you want.

You can delete the **sounds muffled list** or the selected **Anchor** pressing the **delete button**.

The **list of muffled sounds are store in the profile folder**, so you don't need to re-muffle the sounds on every world.

~~**Anchors** are saved in saves/(client world name)/ESM or saves/ESM/ServerWorld if you're playing on a server.~~

**Sounds can be blacklisted** in the config; blacklisted sounds won't appear in the GUI.
